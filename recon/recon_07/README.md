## Objective
For this challenge, your goal is to access the default virtual host ("vhost") over TLS.
## Default vhost over tls

When accessing a new webserver, it often pays off to replace the hostname with the IP address or to provide a random Host header in the request. To do this, you can either modify the request in a web proxy or use:

	curl -H "Host: ...."


This time you need to check the TLS version of the website to get the key

## Solution
 This is also a bit confusing like recon 06
 i found the solution by accident

```
 HINT: https://<ipaddr>
```

**DONE!**
