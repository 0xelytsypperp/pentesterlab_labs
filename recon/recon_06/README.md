## Objective

For this challenge, your goal is to access the default virtual host ("vhost").
## Fuzzing Directories

When accessing a new webserver, it often pays off to replace the hostname with the IP address or to provide a random Host header in the request. To do this, you can either modify the request in a web proxy or use:


```
curl -H "Host:...."
```


## Solution

**DONE!**
