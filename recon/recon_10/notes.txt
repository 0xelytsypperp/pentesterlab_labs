Ok this was a hard one.

First of all i had to learn a new tool [Aquatone](https://github.com/michenriksen/aquatone)
and then i had to think about a logic and create a script that put evey hexdecimal in the link.
After i created the 255 possible links(createhex.py) (e.g. 0xff.a.hackycorp.com) i gave aquatone a shot.
et voil√† you have a folder named screenshots with (if every link works) 255 pictures.
Now you need to inspect every png for the <b>red</b> key
