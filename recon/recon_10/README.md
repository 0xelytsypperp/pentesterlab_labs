## Objective

For this challenge, your goal is to use visual reconnaissance. You will need to find the website with the key in red.

## Visual Reconnaissance

For this challenge, the web applications are hosted under: 0x["%02x"].a.hackycorp.com as in:

    0x00.a.hackycorp.com
    0x01.a.hackycorp.com
    ...
    0x0a.a.hackycorp.com
    0x0b.a.hackycorp.com
    ...

If you haven't done visual reconnaissance before, you can try to use the tool Aquatone to get images that you can browse easily to find the right key.

## Solution

Ok this was a hard one.

First of all i had to learn a new tool [Aquatone](https://github.com/michenriksen/aquatone)
and then i had to think about a logic and create a script that put evey hexdecimal in the link.
After i created the 255 possible links(createhex.py) (e.g. 0xff.a.hackycorp.com) i gave aquatone a shot.
et voil√† you have a folder named screenshots with (if every link works) 255 pictures.
Now you need to inspect every png for the <b>red</b> key

**DONE!**
