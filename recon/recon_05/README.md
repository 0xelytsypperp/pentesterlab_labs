## Objective

For this challenge, your goal is to find a directory that is not directly accessible.

## Fuzzting Directories

When accessing a new webserver, it often pays off to brute force directories. To do this, you can use many tools like [patator](https://github.com/lanjelot/patator), [FFUF](https://github.com/ffuf/ffuf) or [WFuzz](https://wfuzz.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) (amongst many others).

## Solution

You can play around with wfuzz. The common.txt is enough and a little tipp filter for reponse codes. 



**DONE!**
